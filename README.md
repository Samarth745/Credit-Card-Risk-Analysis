Building a Machine Learning model to predict the likely hood of loan repayment
## Introduction
Any leading bank would like to predict whether or not a candinate would be able to repay the loan. 
This projects uses Machine learning Algorithms to predict the possibility of loan repayment by a customer. 
First we Explore the data to understand the relation of defaulters in loan repayment with respect to age, education, debts etc
We use the relation to train the dataset to perform Classification Algorthims in Machine Learning
** Analyzing data of over 1000 applicants to understand the features in project  <br />
* Pre-Processing the data as per requirement
* understanding the relation in Data
* Encoding non numeric columns
* Scaling the data
* Model Selection
* Fine tuning the model
An accuracy of 70 percent was reached with a recall score of 100 using Multi Naive Bayes Algorithm
