Building a Machine Learning model to predict the likely hood of loan repayment

Any leading bank would like to predict whether or not a candinate would be able to repay the loan. 
This projects uses Machine learning Algorithms to predict the possibility of loan repayment by a customer. 
First we Explore the data to understand the relation of defaulters in loan repayment with respect to age, education, debts etc
We use the relation to train the dataset to perform Classification Algorthims in Machine Learning
